            <p>
                My name is Eric, but I go by "ericoc" most places online.
                I am a 20-something nerd and am interested in computers and all things technical.
            </p>
            <p>
                I enjoy Linux, systems administration, computer networking, and pretty much any thing involving the command-line including occasional programming.
                My strongest language is probably PHP.
                While I also regularly script in Bash, I do not think of myself as a developer or programmer.
                I enjoy network and systems administration way more than debugging code.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unrelated to technology, I really like both playing and watching basketball as well as stand-up comedy and baking.
            </p>
