This repository is basically just me playing around learning how to use nginx/uwsgi with python3 (and specifically flask so far) on the web.

I re-wrote my website ([ericoc.com](https://ericoc.com/)) with Python using Flask instead of [the original PHP](https://github.com/ericoc/old.ericoc.com/).

Thanks to [Eliz](https://github.com/Omeryl/) for initial configuration help!!!
