This repository started with me just playing around learning how to use nginx/uwsgi with Python (specifically Flask).

In the past, [my website was primarily PHP](https://github.com/ericoc/old.ericoc.com/), but I feel like I'm getting the hang of Python and appreciate Flask a lot so I'm going to stick with this new version!

Thanks to [Eliz](https://github.com/Omeryl/) for initial configuration help!!!
